    // choose types to preserve memory. Firstly, there is no need to use 64-bit long for LastTimestamp - a smaller
    // timestamp (e.g. in milliseconds) will suffice. Secondly, 128-bit GUID for LastSyncID is also too large. We can
    // implement an approach where nodes can agree on a small unique identifier that will fit into 16 or even 8 bits.
    // Finally, there is no need to store LastValue in this class as it can be retrieved from the World directly.
